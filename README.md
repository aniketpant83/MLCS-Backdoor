**Data Info**
Content Description: The dataset is based on the YouTube Faces dataset, primarily used for facial recognition tasks, featuring a range of face images with varied expressions, poses, and lighting conditions.
Data Splitting: For the purpose of this experiment, the dataset is divided into distinct sets: a validation set valid.h5 for tuning the pruning process, and separate test sets for clean (clean_test.h5) and backdoored (bd_test.h5) data to evaluate the final model.


**Running the code**
- Change path to the data, as desired. In my code, it is mounted to my drive
- Just a simple run all cells
  
**Work in progress**

Model not getting past the pruning step. Upon debugging, I see that there is an issue with respect to the model evaluation which is not ending. 
Have coded the steps after pruning step but have to wait on the pruning step to work.
